# Knock 3 times

Modify the while loop in the function `knock_three_times` to print the string `'Knock Knock'` three times.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't include any other `print` statements outside of your function, because we're strictly checking everything printed. If you print something else, that'll conflict with our tests.
