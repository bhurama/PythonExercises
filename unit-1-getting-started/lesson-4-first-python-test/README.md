# Your First Python Test

Now you have the chance to test Python and Learn by yourself. In the editor at the right ðŸ‘‰ you'll see some Python code.

In the first line (`your_name = ""`) we're defining a variable named `your_name` which was assigned an "empty string". It's just blank/empty text. Go ahead and put your name in it. In my case, I'll have: `your_name = "Santiago"`.

The next variable defined is `course`. This has the value `"Intro to Python"` which represents this course.

We then define the variable `greeting_message`, which looks a little bit more complicated. This variable is using String formatting to merge a "template string" with some values. Don't worry too much about it, we'll learn about it in depth in the future. For now, what you have to know is that we're combining the "fixed" (template-like) text parts like `"Welcome"`, `"to the"` and `"course"` with "dynamic" values contained in our variables `your_name` and `course`. The **final** result of the `greeting_message` variable will be (for my name): `"Welcome Santiago to the Intro to Python course!"`.

Finally, we're printing that message in the screen with the function `print`. Go ahead and run your code using the "Run Code" button:

And you'll see the output:
